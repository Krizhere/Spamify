# 🤖 Spamify – AI Powered Spam Detection System

Spamify is a Machine Learning–based web application that classifies SMS and Email messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** in real time.  

Built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deployed with Streamlit, this project demonstrates end-to-end ML model integration with a modern AI-themed user interface.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a message.
2. Text is preprocessed:
   - Lowercasing
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
   - Stemming
3. TF-IDF Vectorizer transforms the text.
4. Trained ML model predicts whether the message is Spam or Not Spam.
5. AI confidence score is displayed.
